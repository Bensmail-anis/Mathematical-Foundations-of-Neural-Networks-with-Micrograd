# Mathematical-Foundations-of-Neural-Networks-with-Micrograd
This repository is designed for educational purposes to help participants explore the mathematical foundations of neural networks by building a simple backpropagation-based neural network from scratch. We will draw inspiration from Micrograd, a lightweight autograd engine developed by Andrej Karpathy.
